This is the result of following [a tutorial](https://lebcit.github.io/posts/create-a-simple-markdown-based-blog-in-nodejs/#markdown-to-html) by [LebCit](https://github.com/LebCit) on how to create a blog using Markdown files and Node.js. <br>
The tutorial was so concise and easy to follow. The code has plenty of notes about what is what for a newbie to JS like me. I look forward to use this example to create another markdown-based website!
